## Project Overview
This project implements a **Real-Time Tweet Sentiment Analysis API** using **MLOps** practices and **AWS**, offering accurate sentiment categorization. Built with **FastAPI** for high performance, the API provides seamless updates via **AWS CodeDeploy**. It is containerized using **Docker** and deployed on **Kubernetes (K8s)** for scalability and efficiency, enabling real-time sentiment analysis of tweets from social media.

For deployment and monitoring, **Seldon Deployment** is used for model deployment, and **Prometheus** and **Grafana** are utilized for real-time monitoring and metrics visualization. API testing and interaction are done with **Postman**.

## Tools & Technologies
This project utilizes the following tools and technologies:
- **MLOps**: For efficient model tracking, versioning, and deployment.
- **AWS CodeDeploy**: For automating deployment to AWS infrastructure.
- **Kubernetes (K8s)**: For scalable and efficient container orchestration.
- **FastAPI**: For building high-performance APIs.
- **Docker**: For containerizing the application.
- **Seldon Deployment**: For deploying machine learning models at scale.
- **Prometheus**: For collecting real-time metrics.
- **Grafana**: For visualizing real-time metrics and monitoring.
- **Postman**: For API testing and interactions.

## Goal
- This project was developed for **practicing and enhancing skills in MLOps**, including model deployment, monitoring, and real-time updates.

## Monitoring and Optimization
- Real-time monitoring is enabled via **Prometheus** and **Grafana** to ensure system performance and detect issues early.
- **Seldon** helps in deploying and scaling machine learning models, ensuring that they serve predictions efficiently.
